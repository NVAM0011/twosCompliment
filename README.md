# twosCompliment
This is a java file that converts an integer into binary, using the two's compliment system to handle negative integers.
# What this program is:
My goal was to create an easy to understand program that would allow for modification and as a tool for my own learning. I wanted to better understand the conversion between binary and deicmal, and how the two's compliment system stores negative numbers.
# What this program is not:
twosCompliment is not designed with efficiency, performance, or compatibility in mind. It was created as a learning tool to help create an intuition regarding the twos compliment system which is unintuitive and difficult for people who have only used one counting system and notion their whole lives.
